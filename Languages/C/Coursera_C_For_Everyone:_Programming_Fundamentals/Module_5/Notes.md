- Array starts at a base address (we have a bunch of elements, so we want a place to start), then runs through as much memory as is needed which is allocated by the compiler which does it for us
- Array also has relationship with another data type called a pointer
- Array address and pointer relationship
  - When we say "int a;" this means create variable a in memory, which needs to be as many bytes as to store appropriately the values allowed for an integer
    - integer is typically 4 bytes, or 32 bits (each integer takes up 4 mailboxes...billion mailboxes)
    - if we say a = 3...in the 4 bytes we put appropriate representation of binary three, and it will be in some location in memory (which involves gigabytes, or billions of indiviually adressable cells...)
    - each cell in our computer memory has a location which is a number (example: at location 7006, 3 would be stored as a four byte set of memory cells)...when we have variables, the computer has a location/memory and inside of it is a stored value. WAY TO THINK OF IT IS AS BILLIONS OF MAILBOXES, AND IN THE MAILBOXES YOU CAN FIND THINGS LIKE INTEGERS, LONG INTEGERS, DOUBLES, CHARS, STORED AS A BINARY SET OF DIGITS AND INTERPRETED AS A PARTICULAR DATA TYPE
  - When we think of arrays, now we have multiple variables represented
  - Address caluclation = base address + (2 * length of int)
  - _Pointer variables_ are as follows:
    - int *ptr = &a
      - based on above example, ptr would be 7006, because with the *ptr and &a notation above, ptr stores the address of a
      - if we did print(*ptr), we would be _dereferencing_ it and we'd probably get 3...just printing ptr would end up with 7006
- Below example actually is great for understanding this

Video 6 - Call-by-reference simulated
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2075ad0-15e8-4de2-b98d-ec3014252c23)
- C as a language supports call by value
- Many languauges allow call-by-reference; C can simulate this
- address with * can show you its contents
- to know an address, use & operator

- To do call by reference, you have to dereference address (address variable when prefaced by * access contents at address, like *ptr would be 3 while ptr would be 7006)...to know address you use & operator
- Normally parameters are call by value, but you can pass an address (or a pointer)...you call by ref to change values in the calling environment
- Example in the screenshots...a swap function wouldn't work outside of on an internal basis, but when you make the parameters call by reference (prefaced by *) the same function now works

Video 9 - merge sort overview
- bubble sort is for small code...merge sort is better because it's more efficient; have two existing sorted piles and turn them into a combined sorted pile for example
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b726b20e-dcf0-4d3c-8fe1-1a483520642c)
- A general merge code (based off above example):

- How it was working was each pair was put in order; then marging the pairs (look at 1 element, then two elements, then 4 elements)
