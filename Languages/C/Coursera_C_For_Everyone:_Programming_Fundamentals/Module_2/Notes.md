## Character Sets and Tokens (section #2)

Video 1 - Character sets and tokens
- Build a simple program (read in 2 floats, print out the sum of the two floats)
- Like an essay, but can't have misspellings
- Made by characters/lexical elements/tokens such as...
  - Comments (/* .... */)
  - Preprocessor Directives (hash-tag include ...)
  - Identifiers (a, b, main)
  - Operators (+ &)
  - Punctuation ({;})
- Program must be syntactically correct
  - int main()...is wrong
- Program must be semantically correct

Video 2 - Comments
- /* ... */ is a general comment
- // is an end of line comment

Video 3 - Keywords
- From standard ANSI C
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/811ac10a-4816-44ae-a209-435283c276fb)
- Only about 30 for C which is relatively small...for C++, there's many more keywords

Video 4 - Identifiers
- Example: int main()
  - int = keyword
  - main = identifier
- Yes
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cea65299-e034-48b5-bd2a-4049357539a7)
  - Identifiers can be long (03=0
- Not

Video 6 - Expressions and precedence (File included âž•)
- Know the operator function, know its precedence, and know its associativity (see Operator Preference file in the Module_2 main file)
- Example:
  - int a = 1;
  - int b = 2;
  - int c;
  - c = a + b; // c is assigned value of a+b...assignment statement, + is a binary operator
