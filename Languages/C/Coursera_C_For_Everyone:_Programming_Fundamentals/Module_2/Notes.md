## Character Sets and Tokens (section #2)

Video 1 - Character sets and tokens
- Build a simple program (read in 2 floats, print out the sum of the two floats)
- Like an essay, but can't have misspellings
- Made by characters/lexical elements/tokens such as...
  - Comments (/* .... */)
  - Preprocessor Directives (hash-tag include ...)
  - Identifiers (a, b, main)
  - Operators (+ &)
  - Punctuation ({;})
- Program must be syntactically correct
  - int main()...is wrong
- Program must be semantically correct
