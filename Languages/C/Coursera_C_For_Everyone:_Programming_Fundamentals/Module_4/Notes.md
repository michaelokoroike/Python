## Function (section #1)

Video 1 - Function definition
- "The paragraph of Coding"
- Functions are important because...
  - Crucial to reuse of code (especially in libraries)
  - They're a good encapsulation technique
  - Heuristics of functions (what you should think about with writing functions)...
    - Should do one thing well
    - Should be able to keep it to one page
    - Should be able to pretest and posttest it
- Function setup...
  - type func_name
  - (parameter list)
  - {
  - declarations
  - statements
  - }
- Example
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc6e1a6-5cce-4dc2-b956-ca9866790103)
  - the void statement means it returns nothing...prints a statement only
  - call the function with wrt_address();

Video 2 - Function code example
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef102273-d24e-487e-b51f-ea45feae226b)
- Above is the original...below is with the function wrt_very which is the substitute for the while in the original

Video 3 - Return statement
- Return is a flow of control keyword...see it oin first programs we looked at where the end of main is "return 0;"
- Don't have to use it explicitly, but it's a best practice to do so
- Syntax = return; or return expr;

Video 4 - Function prototype
- Need to know a declaration before we can use a function...why you can declare something before it's defined is because of prototypes
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/093a4f21-7a5c-434f-894e-3cf40292accc)
- Above is example..you can call cube, but it is going t  need to be defined later on in the code...maybe after main

Video 6 - Function variablesâ€”with call-by-value explained
- Arguments are call by value

- Note...n value is never changed, only a local version
